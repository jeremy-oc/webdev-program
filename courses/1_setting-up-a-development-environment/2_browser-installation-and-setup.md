# Part 2: Browser Installation and Setup

## Why Multiple Browsers Matter

### Understanding Browser Differences and Compatibility

Different web browsers use different rendering engines, which can cause websites to display or behave differently across browsers. Understanding these differences is crucial for creating websites that work consistently for all users.

#### Major Browser Engines
- **Blink** (Chrome, Edge, Opera) - Most common
- **Gecko** (Firefox) - Independent alternative
- **WebKit** (Safari) - Apple's engine

#### Common Compatibility Issues
- CSS property support variations
- JavaScript API differences
- Default styling inconsistencies
- Performance characteristics
- Security feature implementations

### The Importance of Cross-Browser Testing

Testing your website across multiple browsers ensures:
- **Universal accessibility**: All users can access your content
- **Professional quality**: Consistent experience regardless of browser choice
- **Bug detection**: Issues that appear in one browser but not others
- **Performance optimization**: Different browsers handle resources differently

### Market Share and Target Audience Considerations

Understanding browser market share helps prioritize testing efforts:
- **Chrome**: ~63% global market share
- **Safari**: ~17% (dominant on mobile iOS)
- **Edge**: ~7% (growing, default on Windows)
- **Firefox**: ~4% (privacy-focused users)
